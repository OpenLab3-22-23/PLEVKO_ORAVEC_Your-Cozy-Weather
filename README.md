<h3>Division of our work:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Majo:"I will make design of:  Block to choose location (make search bar), Block after
choosen location(city, temperature, little image like cloud or sun) and background design."</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Yán:"I ’ll use the Weather API data which will parse into our Search bar function which will allow us to find some location. After choosing location it’ll change the behaviour of the background and changes the Block UI to the Second state (showing current temperature, an image with weather and city)" </h4></li>
